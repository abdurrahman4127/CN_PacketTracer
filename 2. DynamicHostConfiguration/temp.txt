DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network protocol used
to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration 
parameters (e.g. subnet mask, default gateway, dns-server, etc.) to devices 
on a network. Its primary purpose is to simplify the process of IP 
address management in a network environment.



say, we're given ip(s) for some networks, and we're to setup dhcp for them.
